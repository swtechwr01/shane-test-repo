= API Authentication Guide

== Introduction

This guide covers various authentication methods and how to set up tokens for secure communication with our API.

== Authentication Methods

=== Basic Authentication
Username and password sent with each request. Simple but less secure for production environments.

=== API Key Authentication
A unique key provided by the API provider sent with requests in headers or query parameters.

=== OAuth 2.0
A modern, secure method that allows token-based access without sharing credentials. Users authorize access through a third-party service.

=== JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
Tokens that contain encoded information and are signed for verification. Commonly used for stateless authentication.

=== Bearer Token
Authorization header format using token-based authentication:

[source,bash]
----
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN
----

== Token Setup

=== Generating API Tokens

. Log into your account on the API provider's website
. Navigate to the API or Settings section
. Look for the option to generate a new API token
. Follow the prompts and save the token securely
. Never share your token in public repositories or client-side code

=== Using API Tokens

. Include the token in your API requests as specified in the documentation
. Add it to the Authorization header as a Bearer token
. Test the token using a REST client like Postman before integration

== Security Best Practices

* Keep tokens secure and never expose them in public repositories
* Regularly rotate your tokens to maintain security
* Use environment variables to store sensitive tokens
* Implement token expiration and refresh mechanisms
* Monitor token usage for suspicious activity
